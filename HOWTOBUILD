Using autotools
---------------
If you've pulled the source from GitHub, you'll need to start with
    autoreconf -i
otherwise go directly to ...
    ./configure
    make
    Optionally make check to run the tests
    Optionally make install

The ./configure checks for installed parsers, Boost, and so on and so forth. If you want to choose on parser over another, having things installed in unusual locations, or whatever, you might need to give it a hand. Running ./configure --help will give the many and varied options you can feed it.
